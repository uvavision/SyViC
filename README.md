# SyViC
This repository is an official implementation of the paper "Going beyond nouns with vision & language models using synthetic data" (ICCV 2023). Here, we present two contributions: the Synthetic Visual Concepts (SyViC) dataset and a novel training strategy for Vision & Language (VL) models. Together, these enhance the models' understanding of complex language concepts without compromising zero-shot capabilities.
